# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
For this milestone, I modified the IntersectsWith and a few other functions to recieve pointers instead of references. I created a LaunchProjectile function with unique pointersthat still needs work. I'm still trying to figure out why it is not returning the unique pointer to the OpponentProjectile object. I readjusted a lot of my previous code to work with unique pointers. I added a method to track the scores and print them in the corner of the screen. I aslo implemented a way to tell whether or not the player is still alive. Then I included these functions as helper functions for the Init and LaunchProjectile. functions.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
Some challenges I encountered wwere with the unique pointers for the launchprojectile function. I was able to implement all of the functions for this assignment, but II got stuck on the test for LaunchProjectile and things went downhill from there. I am still am trying to figure out why the function isn't returning the unique pointer object projectile. I'm still in the pprocessing of trying to debug this. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I've learned from this milestone is the importance of time management and that I probably need to review the concept of unique pointers.
